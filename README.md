# npp

npp, or Ncurses++, is a C++ wrapper for the ncurses library.

I do not aim to wrap all of the nurses functions but only the ones
that I use. However I try to make this wrapper as developer friendly
as possible.

Right now I am doing this project to learn cpp. So please, correct me
if I do things wrong.

I have not written any documentation yet, sorry about that. You can still
check out the `tests/` folder (sometimes it is there, sometimes not...)
if you want some examples.

Have fun ! :D
